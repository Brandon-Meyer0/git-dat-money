## Overview

Contained in this repository you will find notebooks, graphs, and analysis of the data provided to us by our Flatiron teachers (Nick McCarty and Julian Ward) regarding the movie industry as well as resulting business insights we have obtained from working with said information. The information will be in a jupyter notebook file as well as a small presentation with a few slides related to our insights.
